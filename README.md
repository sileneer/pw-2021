## Data

The final data is located in [`distribution/cs_in_subzone.json`](https://github.com/sileneer/pw-2021/blob/master/distribution/cs_in_subzone.json). This includes the final data that we use to plot the graph, as well as the results of the total CS distribution needed for each subzone.

For data of the distribution of CS by population (residential) and carpark (non-residential), they are located in the corresponding subfolder in [`distribution`](https://github.com/sileneer/pw-2021/blob/master/distribution). For reference, kindly check the `.json` files or `.xlsx` files for these data.

## Code

The code that is used to process the data from online sources and calculate the CS distribution are located in corresponding subfolder in [`distribution`](https://github.com/sileneer/pw-2021/blob/master/distribution). 

## Maps

Maps are drawn by [Tableau](https://github.com/tableau). The original files are attached in [`tableau`](https://github.com/sileneer/pw-2021/tree/master/tableau).

The results maps are located in [`output_map`](https://github.com/sileneer/pw-2021/tree/master/output_map). 

## New York City CS Distribution

These are the data that we use to analyse the CS distribution in New York City, and compare it with Singapore's scenario. We then do the regression analysis to find the factors in New York that affect the CS distribution. 

## Petrol Station Distribution

These data are used to compare our CS distribution with the current Singapore's petrol station distribution.
